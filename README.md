# aws-playground

This project is mainly for me to learn how the basic building blocks work. 

I'll try to use the [AWS always free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) to do these.

All of this is written in Feb 2024.

I wanted to explore how to build a [serverless system](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).

Other idea would be to do [event driven system](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/)
using [EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/).

```
~ $ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws
~ $ aws --version
aws-cli/2.15.18 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.2.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
~ $
```
