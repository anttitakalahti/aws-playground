# aws-playground

This project is mainly for me to learn how the basic building blocks work. All of this requires an AWS account and the setup that I have. It might work for you or it might not. 

All of this is written in Feb 2024

```
~ $ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws
~ $ aws --version
aws-cli/2.15.18 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.2.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
~ $
```
